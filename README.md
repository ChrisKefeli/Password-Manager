# Password Manager
This is a password manager created using Java and MySQL.

# **WARNING PLEASE READ**
This side project was just created for fun and to test my skills.
This is not meant to be used as a legitimate password manager and has no encryption. 
Using this is arguably the same or more cumbersome than storing your passwords in a text file on your desktop.


## Prerequisites 
This project requires the installation of MySQL on your local machine and the creation of a MySQL database so that it can store the passwords.


## To-do
- [ ] Flesh out the readme
- [ ] Try and containerize the MySQL database to make the program easier to run
